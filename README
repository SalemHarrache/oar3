If you want to generate RPM packages from the PYPI sources packages:

    - Adapt the spec file (version number)
    - Download the tarball from PYPI to the "SOURCES" directory::

        wget https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/o/oar-lib/oar-lib-%{version}.tar.gz -O SOURCES/oar-lib-%{version}.tar.gz

    - then execute the command::

        rpmbuild -ba SPECS/oar.spec

    - the RPM packages will be created in the "RPMS" directory
